# how to handle dfcs
# currently we just embed another Card in the Card entry in an in-memory cache
# relationally speaking, we need an id that points to the Card representing the back
# so we have two cards with the same set_number but are otherwise different
# problem is that inflates card and faction counts and other things too
# I guess we just have to always filter dfc backs out or uniq on set_num
# but we want the card back to have all the same properties as a regular card.
# the desire at the front-end is the same - we want to just dereference our card back and access 
# all props

# One option is to make a CardData table, and have that hold the bulk of props
# Then have Card delegate to its CardData
